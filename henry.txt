Our brethren are already in the field, Why stand we here idle, What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have, Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God, I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!
